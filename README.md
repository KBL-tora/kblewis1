# About me
Hello I'm Krishana L. and I'm originally from Chicago.
I have lived in Raleigh, NC for 20 years and I am now thinking of living someplace else to change it up a little.
But not before I complete my degree!

## My Interests
I love to dance! I started around the age of 15 and still do contemporary/hip-hop occasionally; I also like singing,
journaling, watching anime (**black nerd** - laughing out loud) and working out.
## Websites I recommend
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) I find YouTube informative with not only looking up a new nail technique I want to try,
  but also researching other things someone might be into: gaming, movie shorts, etc.,.
- [NC Works](https://www.ncworks.gov) I recently come across this website via my roommate, as I am looking for a job and currently
  just doing Lyft on the side, but I decided to put myself back through school last semester and this is a good resource for anyone who is interest
  in also looking (hope this helps).
